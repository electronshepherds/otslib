Welcome to otslib's documentation!
==================================

The otslib library depends heavily on the `gattlib library <https://github.com/labapart/gattlib>`_.
In order to interact with a device you must first create a gattlib adapter and connect to a device.
otslib uses the gattlib connection object to perform its operations. You can look at examples of
how to interact with the gattlib library in the
`examples directory <https://github.com/electronshepherds/otslib/tree/main/examples>`_.
